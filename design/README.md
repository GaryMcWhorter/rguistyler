### rGuiStyler - tool evolution

**raygui_styler** tool development begin on mid-2015, [raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) project had started on December 2014 and after some time developing the library and trying to focus on styling library option, a visual tool to customize style was a requirement.

After some weeks of work a first functional version of a visual style editor was presented:

Despite being a very useful tool, it was left aside for about a year, on June 2016 a redesing of the tool to adapt to new raygui started.

First big change, a brand new raygui color picker, generated in real-time, one single draw call and more functional than the previous one (based on a texture).

Previous list views for controls and properties, directly coded in the tool, were replaced by raygui based ones and tool layout started to be reviewed.

Again, tool UI/UX kept improving day after day, trying different options.
